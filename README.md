# Youtube Music Dynamic Theme

A custom YouTube Music CSS theme that sets the background to the current song’s cover with blur, subtle animations for a lively feel and Glass-Like UI.

Requires **Better Lyrics** extension for the dynamic background and time-synced lyrics features.

This CSS was **NOT entirely written by me**. I **edited** it using a CSS made by **walm-git** as the base. I also incorporated parts from other scripts I found online for inspiration and to fix issues I couldn’t figure out myself. (credits below)

The theme is heavily inspired by **"Even Better Lyrics Plus by Noah & BetterLyrics"** for the Better Lyrics extension.

**Note**: The background animation may be CPU-intensive on your PC. You can disable it in the configuration if needed.

**Browser Notes:**
Background transitions don’t work in Firefox yet.
The search box blur only works in Firefox, not sure why it doesn’t in Chromium-based browsers.

## How to Update
1. Click **Manage** in the extension tab to open the style manager.

If you don’t see the update icon, make sure **Check for Updates** is enabled in the editor: click the style name and check the left-hand tab for the option.

Check if there’s a **raw GitHub** link inside, like the image above. If not, it’s best to reinstall the theme.

**Small Note**: I do not know how to code or fully understand CSS, so there might be some messy lines and room for improvement. This was originally made for my personal use, but I decided to share it here. Enjoy!
