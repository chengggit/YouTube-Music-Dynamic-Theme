# Youtube Music Dynamic Theme

A custom YouTube Music CSS theme that sets the background to the current song’s cover with blur, subtle animations for a lively feel and Glass-Like UI.

Requires **Better Lyrics** extension for the dynamic background and time-synced lyrics features.

This CSS was **NOT entirely written by me**. I **edited** it using a CSS made by **walm-git** as the base. I also incorporated parts from other scripts I found online for inspiration and to fix issues I couldn’t figure out myself. (credits below)

The theme is heavily inspired by **"Even Better Lyrics Plus by Noah & BetterLyrics"** for the Better Lyrics extension.
