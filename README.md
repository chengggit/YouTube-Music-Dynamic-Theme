# Youtube Music Dynamic Theme

A custom YouTube Music CSS theme that sets the background to the current song’s cover with blur and subtle animations for a lively feel. Requires **Better Lyrics** extension for the dynamic background and time-synced lyrics features.

This CSS was **NOT entirely written by me**. I **edited** it using a CSS made by **walm-git** as the base. I also incorporated parts from other scripts I found online for inspiration and to fix issues I couldn’t figure out myself. (credits below)

The theme is heavily inspired by **"Even Better Lyrics Plus by Noah & BetterLyrics"** for the Better Lyrics extension.

**Small Note**: I do not know how to code or fully understand CSS, so there might be some messy lines and room for improvement. This was originally made for my personal use, but I decided to share it here. Enjoy!
