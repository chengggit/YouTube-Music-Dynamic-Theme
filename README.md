# YouTube Music Dynamic Theme

![](/images/Main.webp)
A custom YouTube Music CSS theme that sets the background to the current song’s cover with blur, subtle animations for a lively feel and Glass-Like UI.

Requires **Better Lyrics** extension for the dynamic background and time-synced lyrics features.

**Note**: The background animation may be CPU-intensive on your PC. You can disable it in the configuration if needed.

#### Install with Stylus
**Stylus version will stay at V2.0.6.2 and will not receive further updates.**

 [Stylus Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) is needed.

1. Click this button below to install.

    [![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chengggit/Youtube-Music-Dynamic-Theme/refs/heads/main/mycustom.user.css)

**Unfortunately, I’ve decided to discontinue the Stylus theme. Maintaining and porting two separate versions for Stylus and Better Lyrics has become too draining, so it will no longer receive updates.**

**Browser Notes:**

- Background transitions don’t work in Firefox yet.
- Search box background blur only works in Firefox, not sure why it doesn’t in Chromium-based browsers.

The theme is also heavily inspired by “Even Better Lyrics Plus” by Noah & BetterLyrics for **Better Lyrics** extension.

# Thank You ❤️

This CSS was originally based on a theme made by **walm-git.** Since then, I’ve gone through and studied almost every part of it. Now, it’s almost entirely written by me. Countless hours spent in DevTools, asking ChatGPT for explanations and solutions, studying other people’s code, hunting for hidden elements, dealing with frustration, and killing my back. I’m proud to say this has become the best thing I’ve ever created.

I just want to say thank you to everyone using this theme. I hope you enjoy it and love it as much as I do. Thank you to everyone who has supported this project from the start, to those who commented on my Reddit post, shared kind words, and to the people I credited above.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Cheng
