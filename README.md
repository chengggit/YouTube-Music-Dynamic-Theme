# Youtube Music Dynamic Theme

A custom YouTube Music CSS theme that sets the background to the current song’s cover with blur, subtle animations for a lively feel and Glass-Like UI.

Requires **Better Lyrics** extension for the dynamic background and time-synced lyrics features.

This CSS was **NOT entirely written by me**. I **edited** it using a CSS made by **walm-git** as the base. I also incorporated parts from other scripts I found online for inspiration and to fix issues I couldn’t figure out myself. (credits below)

**Note**: The background animation may be CPU-intensive on your PC. You can disable it in the configuration if needed.

**Browser Notes:**
Background transitions don’t work in Firefox yet.
The search box blur only works in Firefox, not sure why it doesn’t in Chromium-based browsers.

## How to Update (Stylus only)
1. Click **Manage** in the extension tab to open the style manager.

**Small Note**: I do not know how to code or fully understand CSS, so there might be some messy lines and room for improvement. This was originally made for my personal use, but I decided to share it here. Enjoy!

# Thank You ❤️

This CSS was originally based on a stylesheet made by **walm-git.** Since then, I’ve gone through and studied almost every part of it. Now, it’s almost entirely written by me. Countless hours spent in DevTools, asking ChatGPT for explanations and solutions, studying other people’s code, hunting for hidden elements, dealing with frustration, and killing my back. I’m proud to say this has become the best thing I’ve ever created.

I’ve kept the original credit for walm-git because without their CSS as a foundation, I wouldn’t have been able to take it this far.

I just want to say thank you to everyone using this theme. I hope you enjoy it and love it as much as I do. Thank you to everyone who has supported this project from the start, to those who commented on my Reddit post, shared kind words, and to the people I credited above.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Cheng
